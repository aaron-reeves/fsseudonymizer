# _Fsseudonymizer:_ System requirements and installation

## System requirements

### For Microsoft Windows

_Fsseudonymizer_ should work with any recent release of _Microsoft Windows_ (7, 8, or 10)*.  _Fsseudonymizer_ is available both as a 32-bit application and a 64-bit application.  Provided that you have a 64-bit version of _Microsoft Windows_, the 64-bit version of _Fsseudonymizer_ is recommended, as it is capable of handling substantially larger data files.

* It is possible that users of very recent releases of *Microsoft Windows 10* or users with recent *Microsoft Surface* Pro 2-in-1 tablets may encounter problems.  Should you experience such problems, [we would like to hear from you](contacts.md).

### For other operating systems

Although release packages of _Fsseudonymizer_ are not available for other operating systems, the application is written using only cross-platform tools, and it should be possible to build the application for _Mac_ and _Linux_ systems.  See [notes for developers](developers.md) or [contact us](contacts.md) for more information.

## Installation

### For Microsoft Windows

Installation is straightforward.  Simply select and download an installer package from XYZ, and double-click to run the installer.  Follow the on-screen prompts to customize the desired installation options.  By default, an icon for _Fsseudonymizer_ will be created on your *Windows* Start menu.

### For other operating systems

At the current time, there are no installer packages of _Fsseudonymizer_ for _Mac_ or _Linux_ systems, but it should be possible to build the application from source code.  See [notes for developers](developers.md) or [contact us](contacts.md) for more information.
